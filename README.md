This is a hotel listing website built using ReactJS that allows users to browse and explore various properties in different cities. The website offers several features, including city tabs, property card listings, lazy loading of properties, and property details pages.

## Features

- **City Tabs**: The website features city tabs at the top. By default, the first tab is active. Clicking on any other tab will make it active and display properties for that city.

- **Property Cards**: The properties are displayed in a card format, with three cards per row. Each card provides essential information about the property.

- **Lazy Loading**: To improve performance and user experience, new properties are loaded when the "Show More" button is clicked. This ensures even with a large number of properties.

- **Property Details Page**: Clicking on a property card will navigate the user to a dedicated property details page at `/property/:id`. This page provides more detailed information about the selected property.
